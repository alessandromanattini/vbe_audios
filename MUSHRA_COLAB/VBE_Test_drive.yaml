      content: Welcome to webMUSHRA!The goal of this experiment is to evaluate the perceived quality of a new method for enhancing low frequencies; since the focus is on the bass and sub-bass range, it is essential to use high-quality headphones to correctly perceive the nuances. In each test trial, you will find a Reference file, which is the original unprocessed audio, and several test conditions to compare against it. Your task is to listen to the Reference and evaluate the quality of each condition by assigning a score from 0 to 100. Please note that an exact copy of the Reference (Hidden Reference) is always hidden among the test conditions and should ideally receive the maximum score. When rating, look for an improvement in bass depth and presence, but be careful not to reward tracks that introduce distortion, muddiness, or loss of clarity. A high score (80-100) indicates enhanced but clean and natural bass, while low scores should be assigned if there are audible artifacts, distortion, or if the sound becomes muddy and degraded compared to the original.

      content: This training shows how to use our user interface. Please perform the underlined instructions to proceed with the training session. The interface features a central waveform display of the audio track, accompanied by a horizontal timeline slider underneath that allows you to navigate or loop specific sections of the song as desired. A Stop button is located on the left to halt playback. The main Play button triggers the Reference track; you can then click on the individual Condition buttons to perform a rapid, seamless switch between the different processed versions for direct comparison. Below each condition, vertical sliders are provided to assign a quality score. Please keep in mind that one of these test conditions is a Hidden Reference, identical to the original audio.
